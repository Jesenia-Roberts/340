I will develop readable code by having well-defined variables and methods along with comments like the ones given in the starter code as I found them to be explanatory and useful. Having separate methods for each task such as what I did during the CRUD module helps to keep code organized and simple. I approach issues as a computer scientist by doing as much research as possible and giving my best attempt at finishing the final product in a satisfactory way. Something that I must improve on is time management and the ability to ask for as much help as is needed. In the future I imagine to describe databases I will make diagrams, as I found myself doing that on my own to keep track of where things were located in the database. Computer scientists use their programming skills to create. They solve issues with programming and assist companies, such as Grazioso Salvare realize their visions.
